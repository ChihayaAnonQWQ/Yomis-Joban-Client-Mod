- **The slanted SIL signs work.** The two SIL shapes are V-shaped: their halves face opposite ways,
  so one 22.5-degree lean comes out mirrored and forms the V. YJCM's own renderer leans the panel
  with `mulPose(XP.rotationDegrees(rotation))` between the facing rotations and the panel
  translate; this port never did, so a script panel was drawn flat and straight through the middle
  of the V. The lean is supported now, and the two SIL shapes carry their own translate —
  (-0.21, -0.410, -0.520) against the plain RV's (-0.21, -0.14, -0.114) — because YJCM's renderer
  is handed (startY 11.7, startZ 2.45, rotation 22.5) for them and (8.25, 6, 0) for the plain one.
  Every one of those numbers was measured in game; the table is in the port document.
- **The preset field completes on Tab.** It suggested ids and Enter filled one in, but the ids are
  long and the list could not be walked. Tab takes the next candidate and keeps walking on repeat,
  wrapping at the end, and typing by hand resets the walk — the behaviour vanilla's command
  suggestions have, which this widget was written to imitate.

## Changes
- **The panel no longer floats off its block.** JCM 2.x's panel translate (`-0.128` on Z) was
  tuned against MTR 4's model; MTR 3's RV model is a mount rather than a screen — a base, two
  side plates running the block's full depth along its centre line, and a pole — so the panel sat
  0.148 blocks out and the gap was plain to see from the side. It is 0.134 now. The usable range
  is narrow and was measured in game: 0.120 puts the panel inside the mount and the plates cut
  through it, 0.148 clears it but reads as a floating board.
- **Presets that draw a row as several elements no longer creep outward line by line.** The depth
  step between draw calls was `-0.1` script units — 500 times JCM 2.x's `0.0002`, and 5 times it
  in blocks — so forty calls accumulated 4 cm and `met_bus_stop` and the Japanese-style packs
  came out as a staircase. The large step was a workaround for the flicker the old sorted batch
  produced; quads are drawn one at a time now, in call order, so nothing competes for depth and
  the step is back to JCM 2.x's value.

# Yomi's Joban Client Mod 1.2.12-JSPIDS-1.1

Version numbers follow the upstream release this fork is built on, with the JS-PIDS port revision
appended (`1.2.12-JSPIDS-1.0` was the first published port build).

## Changes
- **Overlays drawn by a PIDS preset no longer vanish.** Badges, platform circles and weather
  icons were invisible on some packs while the panel background came out fine. Script quads are
  now drawn through the engine's own buffer and uploaded immediately, so a preset's calls reach
  the screen in the order it made them — which is what JCM 2.x's queued renderer gives them.
  This matters on any pack where another mod takes over entity rendering: *Accelerated
  Rendering* mixes into `MultiBufferSource.BufferSource.getBuffer`, so the quads never reached
  a buffer that could be flushed in order, and only the background survived.
- **A panel's own station is now the one it stands at, not an arbitrary one.** The block
  entity's platform list is a `Set`, so taking its first element picked a platform at the other
  end of the line: HKR's route-map strip drew the line's opening stations and the platform
  number and "arriving here" wording followed the wrong station. MTR's rule — the platform
  closest to the block — is used now.
- **MTR 4-shaped fields are exposed on the script objects**, because Rhino hands back a bound
  method for a property lookup on a method: `pids.station().name` returned a function object
  rather than the name. `Station.name/id/zone`, a route stop's `station` and `route`, and
  `route.name` are fields now, with the accessor methods kept.
- **`departureTime()` counts from the arrival plus the platform's dwell time**, in MTR's
  half-seconds. It used to return the arrival time, so HKR's door-closing display could never
  appear; with a 20-second stop it now shows for the last ten seconds before departure.
